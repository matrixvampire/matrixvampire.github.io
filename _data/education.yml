    During my time I learnt about what is research and how it can help you to explore new innovative ideas. I did my master thesis on *AUDIO VIDEO TRANSMISSION TECHNOLOGY FOR ASSISTANCE OF THE BLIND* providing solution how a sighted person can assist a blind person.

    I spent my free time as volunteering in Student Union activities and participate as instructor on Wireless Networks Workshop.
